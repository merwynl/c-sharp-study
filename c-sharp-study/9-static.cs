         *                    - Useful for when you require some sort of shared attribute/behaviour amongst various
         *                      objects.
         *                    - You're kinda making a member "globally accessible".
         *                    - When defining something as static, you are making that item belong to the class itself
         *                      as opposed to a specific instance or object.
